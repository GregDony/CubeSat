-the voltage requirements of each subgroup. We are assuming these will be 12, 5, or 3.3V but if there are others we will do our best to accommodate. 

-the power usage of each subgroup (min and max values) for each of the operating modes. We would like to know which components are on during eclipse and safe mode. 

-the absoute requirement as well as the best-case-scenario values for the amount of time the high power usage components will be on (transceiver, camera, etc)
