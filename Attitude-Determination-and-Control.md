Information on the Attitude Determination and Control System for both _Spirit_ and _Opportunity_

**Brief Descriptions of Attitude Determination and Control System (ADCS)**

The ADCS will provide accuracy and stability to the spacecraft to ensure mission success. Although there have been other attitude determination and control systems created for other CubeSat projects, the ADCS will be created based on the specifications determined for this specific CubeSat.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Operational Modes:**
1) Detumbling: After the initial release of the CubeSat, the ADCS must be able to stabilize the CubeSat's attitude and bring its velocity to zero.
2) Nominal: When the CubeSat is in orbit, the ADCS must be able to stabilize the CubeSat's attitude.
3) Imaging: Points the camera at a specific point and stabilizes the CubeSat at a certain attitude for imaging purposes.
4) Safe mode: Ensure CubeSat stays power positive, ensure communication with ground (?), prevent momentum acceleration.
5) Data dump: Points the antenna towards ground and stabilizes the CubeSat at a certain attitude to optimize data dump.

**Current Tasks:** 
- Selection of preliminary sensors and actuators to provide information to Structural/Thermal teams and EPS.
- Development of a model to simulate the CubeSat Attitude Determination and Control System during the detumbling operation mode.
