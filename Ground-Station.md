# Responsibilities
## Orbit Tracking System
* Developing a predictive model for determining the location of the satellite in space given telemetric information 
* Correcting for pointing error to ensure maximum uplink during 
* Designing algorithms to determine pointing angles given geological location and elevation

## Angular Position System
* Position the antennae to point in the direction of the satellite to enable data transfer
* Implementing feedback loop using rotary sensors to get exact angular position
* Ensuring selected actuators can function in varying environments under the loads exerted by the equipment

## Positioning Control System
*
