Information on the Structures and Thermal subsystem for _Spirit_

Problem Statement:
	This project will involve the capstone group to work with other engineering capstone teams to design a complete 2U CubeSat system that will be launched after 2021. The payload of this 2U CubeSat will be a two VR(Virtual Reality) cameras provided by Canadensys.  These cameras will take a single 180 degree picture each and will combine to create a full 360 degree view.  Specifically, the capstone team will be part of the Spirit Thermal and Structural Team.  The Spirit name distinguishes between UMF and S-Band communication networks; the Spirit indicator meaning S-Band communications.
 
S-Band antenna technology is used in many space applications, including CubeSats. They operate at frequencies between 2-4 GHz. This band is specifically reserved for Space to Earth transmission of Telemetry, tracking, and command (TT&C), ranging data and payload data. The reason the antenna dictates so much of satellites design is because the patch antenna is has an area of about 10x10cm and is required to point down at the Earth at all times. Given the volume constraints of the Nanoracks launcher, the patch antenna must be placed at the bottom occupying the entire face of the Cubesat.

The Spirit mechanical design team will be responsible for the structural design and thermal control of the CubeSat.  The structural design will involve layout of internal components, regulating the mass budget, and most importantly designing a frame robust enough to withstand the harsh space environment and the vibrations during launch.  Thermal design will involve the control of the thermal budget, implementation of various heat transfer apparatuses, and creation of a thermal model able to sufficiently predict maximum and minimum temperatures.

As we work through our design of the CubeSat structure, we will be performing multiple design and analysis iterations while we perform our own reviews and receive feedback from the other teams. This will culminate in building a physical prototype for testing and use in demonstrations.

Almost half of the failed CubeSat projects were unable to make contact after launch.  Upon closer review of the failure reports a common theme emerged.  More than half of these no contact failures were caused by interfacing failure to the communications system.    It is believed that these problems would have easily been found if the CubeSat had been operated in a flight equivalent state.  The majority of no contact failures were also university CubeSat projects.  It seemed as though industry CubeSat projects did not have a no contact problem nearly as often as university projects.  It is presumed that this phenomenon is due to a lack of experience from university students and the “assumption [by students] that the spacecraft will work as expected the first time it is put together, and thus they do not perform system-level functional tests”13.  In conclusion, as the Spirit mechanical design group we must ensure that the structural and thermal conditions of the CubeSat is thoroughly tested in its in flight state to safeguard against unforeseen conditions.
