### Thermal Regulation

- We need: Operating and Survival temperature ranges of all components panning to be used

- How can we position the components to best evenly distribute possible dissipated heat from operations?

- Thermal regulation can be achieved by :

           Multilayer insulation (MLI) blankets
	   
           Radiators - flat-plate radiators on the side of satellite
	
           Coatings- certain materials can act as thermal control surfaces 
		
           Solar reflectors, solar absorbers, flat reflectors, and flat absorbers
	
           Heaters- patch heater with control switchcoatings or insulation blankets 

- Thermistors for temperature measurement and control

### Vibrations

- We will only be using sliding or locking connectors to avoid threaded connections possibly becoming loose during launch

- Can we use internal components for further structural support? 

### Planning

- Mass budget is 3.6 kg although we are aiming for a 20% margin so about 2.88 kg (6.3 lbs)

- We want to try and ballpark what percent of the mass budget each team will need 

- Post and panel assembly seems to be the cheaper and easier way to assemble the exterior structure
         
            - Now there are many off-the-shelf assembly kits available to buy that have pre-drilled holes for some degree of customization

            - The cameras may not fit with the assembly kit 

            - If machining is needed in order to have the cameras fit then additional support may be needed to strengthen the structure
