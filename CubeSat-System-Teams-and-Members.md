The Preliminary Design Phase of the CubeSat Project features two parallel system designs to be traded off in Spring 2019. The two system designs are named 'Spirit' and 'Opportunity' so as to not imply one is ranked higher than the other. The Structures and Thermal subsystem, Electrical Power subsystem, and Communications subsystem each have 1 group working on each system design concept. The Onboard Computer subsystem and Attitude Determination and Control subsystem will be similar enough for both system design concepts. The Ground Segment, comprising of the Ground Station and the Mission Control Operations Software subsystems must be robust to either system design.
