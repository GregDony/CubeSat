Information on the Electrical Power System for _Opportunity_

Needs:

-voltage level requirements of each subgroup. We are assuming these will be 12, 5, or 3.3V but if there are others we will do our best to accommodate. 

-which components are on during each operating mode and power requirements for minimum necessary operation as well as best-case-scenario (or ideal) levels if these are possible 

Coming Soon:

-we will be narrowing down our options for off-the-shelf vs self-assembled components comprising the EPS and this will confirm our masses, max and min generated power, and possible interfaces with the overall CubeSat design. When the decisions are made we will update them here 

Overall:

-the EPS will include solar panels, batteries, and a protection/distribution board that will communicate directly with the computer
