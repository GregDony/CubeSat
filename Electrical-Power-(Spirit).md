Information on the Electrical Power system for _Spirit_

# **Current Focus**
-Selecting 3 options for main electrical components 
* Solar Panels - conducting tradeoff between efficiency, mass, effective area, expected power
* Power Management & Distribution System - Looking to be commercial bought. PMDS units can have integrated processors included so future collaboration with the on-board computer team will be necessary to explore multiple solutions
* Battery - principle requirement is to store enough power for the eclipse period. Material mass and primary cell composition are considered for maximizing lifetime and minimizing cost.
* DC-DC Converter - The common bus voltages for Cubesats are 3.3V-4.2V and 5V-9V. A high efficient converter circuit contains resistors, inductors, capacitors and IC(integrated circuit) which is achievable within limited space. 

# **EPS Deliverables**
* Tentative Power Budget will be released for different operational modes ~Oct 25
* Preliminary Solar Panel Options

# **Needs**
* Voltage requirements for on-board computer, payload, communication system, attitude control **High Priority**
* Orbit path for worst case scenario i.e. incident angle from sun for each panel face, time spent facing sun, time in eclipse **Low Priority**
